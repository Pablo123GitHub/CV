## Pablo Vidal

I have more than 12 years experience in support roles for technology companies. Now retraining in web development, focussing my training mainly on JavaScript with a keen interest in React JS. I post a weekly summary of my progress here : https://pablo123github.github.io/TrackingProgress/

Throughout my support roles my main drive has always been to give the best possible experience to customers by putting myself in their shoes: often reproducing the problems that they were facing in order to find the most adequate solution.  

I see web development as a logical evolution which allows me to take my problem solving skills to the next level. I would ideally see myself in a junior web developer position with strong emphasis on learning and professional growth.

## Skills

#### Troubleshooting

- Ability to describe methodically each and every step that leads to the problem in order to find the best solution
- Reading company internal procedures on a regular basis in order to address any given problem with best practice procedures
- Welcoming any "*uncommon*" problem as it is always a good opportunity to learn and grow professionally.

#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript  

- Championing specific features of the product (Zendesk): one of them being the Zendesk end user interface requiring HTML/CSS/JS knowledge in order to troubleshoot the problem
- When the problem was simple, I could provide a code to solve basic problems (JavaScript) or provide work arounds based on JavaScript.

#### Communication

- Communicating efficiently with customers to provide a solution or feedback from other teams in the company (Development, Operations, Marketing)
- Communicating efficiently with internal teams (specially the Sales team) in order to keep them in the loop regarding any customers that require special attention (key accounts)
- Providing support in company events (Zendesk) when necessary (once or twice a year): meeting customers face to face

#### Internal promotion

- At Zendesk (September 2011 to December 2016), I moved internally from Tier 1 to Tier 2 support  
- At Kingston Technology (September 2007 - October 2010)  , I moved from Customer Service to Tech Support

#### Languages

- French (Native standards)
- Fluent English (Business standards)
- Good Spanish (Advanced standards)

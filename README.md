## Pablo Vidal

I have more than 12 years experience in support roles for technology companies. Now retraining in web development, focussing my training mainly on JavaScript with a keen interest in React JS.  

I see web development as a logical evolution which allows me to take my problem solving skills to the next level. I would ideally see myself in a position where I can continue to grow as a web developer.

## Skills

#### Troubleshooting

- Ability to describe methodically the steps that lead to the problem in order to find the best solution.
- Welcoming any "*uncommon*" problem as it is always a good opportunity to learn and grow professionally.


#### Communication

- As tech support at Zendesk, I effectively communicated solutions found by our developers to our clients and provided feedback to our marketing and operations team as we developed our product.
- Providing support in company events (Zendesk) when necessary (once or twice a year): meeting customers to give support on the product developed by the company.

#### Internal promotion

I was recognised for my dedication to customer service and interest in technology and got promoted both at Kingston Technology and Zendesk.

- Fluent English (Business standards)
